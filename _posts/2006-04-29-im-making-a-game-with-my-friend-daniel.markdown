The game is AEther Sailing the wine dark sky.  
AEther is, or rather will be, a massively multiplayer online game. Players will control spaceships, from a top-down third-person view. Our goal is to create an environment in which players are free to do whatever they want, from making money and destroying other players' ships to constructing new ships and components and founding interstellar empires. To accomplish this, we intend to create a framework that is easily extensible, both by our plugins and by player-written scripts. We are developing it primarily for Mac OS X, using Cocoa and Objective-C. Hopefully, we will be able to use GNUstep (which is in essence an open-source implementation of Cocoa) to port it to a number of other platforms, including Windows and many distributions of Linux.

At this point we have a reasonably functional engine for rigid-body mechanics, which we can use to model motion and collisions in two dimensions. We are working on the remainder of the game engine. We expect to have a demo with basic functionality by the end of the summer
