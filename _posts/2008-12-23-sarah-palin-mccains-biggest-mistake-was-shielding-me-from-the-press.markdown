> GIZZI: What was the **biggest mistake made in the '08 campaign**? PALIN: The biggest mistake made was that I could have called more shots on this: the opportunities that were not seized to speak to more Americans via media. I was not allowed to do very many interviews, and the interviews that I did were not necessarily those I would have chosen. But I was so thankful to have the opportunity to run with John McCain that I was not going to argue with the strategy decisions that some of his people were making regarding the media contacts. But if I would have been in charge,** I would have wanted to speak to more reporters because that's how you get your message out to the electorate.**

*TTTTHHHHHWWWWWAAAAAAMMMMMP* (That was the sound of my jaw hitting the floor.) why did i smash my jaw? [because](http://crooksandliars.com/2008/09/11/ready-to-lead-palin-doesnt-know-what-the-bush-doctrine-is) [i](http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/09/30/omg-palin-cant-name-one-magazinenewspaper-she-reads/) [remember](http://crooksandliars.com/2008/10/02/brutal-palin-cant-name-a-single-supreme-court-case-she-disagrees-with-other-than-roe-v-wade) [the campaign.](http://crooksandliars.com/2008/08/29/sarah-palin-july-2008-i-dont-even-know-what-the-vice-president-does) Sarah Palin, along with Mike Huckabee, Newt Gingrich, and Bobby Jindal, has emerged from the campaign season as one of these people who seems think that the reason they lost had to do with the GOP's inability to articulate a true conservative message. I'll put it to you: do you think that after a 24 month campaign with non-stop coverage from a multitude of sources, and after eight years of front-and-center conservatism, that Americans don't understand what the conservative message is? Did Americans just take the decade off and stop reading the news? Occum's Razor tells us it's the former. so does a whole freaking crap load of Obama voters. So does the shifting demography of the United States. Sarah Palin's critique shouldn't be volleyed at McCain, but rather at conservatism itself as the biggest mistake of her campaign, because voters are all too aware of the detriments of conservatism. Thanks Bush for helping create a TRUE MORAL MAJORITY.
