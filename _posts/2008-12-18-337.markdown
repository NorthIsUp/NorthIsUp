A big day for Al Franken. The Supreme Court says the rejected absentee ballots must be counted. This a big victory for franken, since the lead colemen held was so small, and the number of ballots in the democratic leaning pile of rejected votes i 1,600; enough to deliver Franken the "W". ![](http://images.huffingtonpost.com/gen/54512/thumbs/s-FRANKEN-large.jpg)

> **The Minnesota Supreme Court said improperly rejected absentee ballots must be counted by the state Canvassing Board, something Coleman tried to prevent. **But they won't be counted immediately, and Coleman and Franken must agree on which ones are tallied. Meanwhile, as the state Canvassing Board continued working its way through challenged ballots, **DFLer Franken all but erased Republican Coleman's lead** in the U.S. Senate recount and appeared poised to pull ahead today. But his gains could in turn prove short-lived when thousands of previously disputed ballots are added to the tally .... The court ruled against Coleman's attempt to block the Canvassing Board from counting any improperly rejected absentee ballots, but said such ballots can be counted only when both campaigns and local officials agree they have been improperly excluded. ... With as many as 1,600 absentee ballots improperly rejected by local elections officials, those votes could be a deciding factor in a razor-tight race.

Meanwhile, it looks like Nate Silver's[](http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/projection-franken-to-win-recount-by-27.html) would only be a a few dozen votes off as Franken is now being projected the victor: 

> As of 8PM ET, the Minneapolis Star Tribune projected that Franken would finish the recount process with a lead of 89 votes, positioning him to become the 59th senator caucusing with Democrats in the upcoming Congress. According to local paper tallies, Franken currently trails Sen. Norm Coleman by a mere five votes, down from the 358-vote margin that the Republican held just last night. The Associated Press has the count even closer, with Coleman ahead by [two votes](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20081218/minnesota-senate). An aide to Franken told the Huffington Post that, according to the campaign's internal count, Franken has already taken a small lead. The gains came as the canvassing board sifted through hundreds of ballots that Coleman had contested during the recount process. On Friday, the canvassing board will consider another 400 or so Coleman challenges. If the pattern remains consistent, Franken should vault past his opponent to a projected lead of approximately 89 votes, [according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune](http://senaterecount.startribune.com/ballots/).
