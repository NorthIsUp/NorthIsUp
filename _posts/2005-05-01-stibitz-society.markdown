The Stibitz Society is the computer science organization at Denison University. It was founded to promote logical and mathematical thought and discussion. It is named after Denison alumnus George Stibitz whom, as you may know, created the first binary adder. Since he worked for Bell labs it was made out of mechanical telephone switches making it far slower, but much more reliable than, the its vacuum tube followers.

We also participate in the fall ACM programing contest each year as well as hosting our own in the spring semester. This year we only placed in the top 16 (of ~160 I believe) where we were in the top 8 the year before. We have taken top prize at the Denison Programing Contest for the past three years. This year, however, the competition was steep and the problems difficult; we came in third having solved five of six problems
