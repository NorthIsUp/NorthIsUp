This morning, Barack Obama's transition team released an economic evaluation of the president-elect's stimulus plan, making the case for an urgent infusion of public spending to right the economy. Christine Romero, the chair-designate for Obama's National Economic Council, [discusses the report](http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/video_christna_romer_explains_a_new_report_about_job_creation/) in the video below.
