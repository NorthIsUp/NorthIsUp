From [Think Progress](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/01/scott_mcclellan_the_white_house_press_briefing_is_obsolete.php):  


> Asked by TNR to offer some advice to White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, former Press Secretary Scott McClellan makes the provocative suggestion that the whole briefing ritual is passe:  
  
** My view is that the press-briefing model that is used now is kind of outdated. **It ought to be more along the lines of the Pentagon briefing model, where you're bringing in on a regular basis-maybe even two to three times a week-key officials from the White House or Cabinet secretaries to participate in these briefings and help educate the press and the public.  
  
I agree with that. In terms of the basic briefing material, this could just as easily be emailed out to everyone on the press list. Meanwhile, the Q&A sessions that exist now are useless as a source of actual information. Reporters ask questions that they know perfectly well won't be answered, and then the press secretary does his best to dodge him. Nine days out of ten, the result is a not-very-amusing spectacle for mid-day C-SPAN viewers. If the world is lucky, the Press Secretary commits some kind of gaffe. But nothing real is ever learned. McClellan's idea, by contrast, holds some promise. The White House could bring out whoever they wanted. But the expectation would be clearâ€”you brought these people out to talk about something in particular, and they're really expected to talk about it.

  
  
I like the idea of adopting the Pentagon briefing model. The current white house press briefing don't really make for good transparency for a few reasons. The first is the short time limit. press briefings are too short and there isn't wiggle room to explore deeper issues. Only a few questions are taken, and followups are rare. Next, the sound byte problem. If the White House has a guy that talks in sound bytes, then the media has to cover sound bytes. Sound bytes are inherently superficial. If the press is getting a superficial udnerstanding of the issues, then we are at best getting a superficial discussion of the issues. These are the conditions that create shoddy reporting and a bias towards speculation - lack of substance becomes compensated by "analysis".  
  
What would I like? How about we replace the White House press briefings with "press seminars". There should be a central office where a full time staff is working to provide a dailong seminar with the press corps. These seminars would facilitate discussions between the press and the whitehouse in a teacher-student sort of way. This isn't proganda. This is the White House bending over backwards to teach everything there is to know about its policies. Reporters can ask qrestions and get one-on-one "tutoring" on whatever subjects they are writing about. This would help combat ditto heading in the media - when everybody reports the same factoid, even though the information is suspect.   
  
Why shouldn't the white house have a massive press department? Why wouldn't the white house want the American public to get the information it asks of its government? Having reporters go through an educational process with the government doesn't have to be thought of as some Orwellian nightmare. Instead, it could be a good government doing its best to assist the people, and reporters doing the best to understand the state of our democracy.
