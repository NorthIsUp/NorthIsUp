With recent advances in solar technology such as [spray on](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/01/0114_050114_solarplastic.html) or [peel 'n stick](http://www.triplepundit.com/pages/peel-stick-solar-fulfills-the--003101.php) solar panels it has become technically feasible to put a solar panel on the top of a consumer vehicle. Even better would be an electric consumer vehicle. I can't wait until somebody mods their Volt.
