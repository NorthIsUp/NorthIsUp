So, I did not get my job with Apple, alas, but I still am young. This did, however leave me in a precarious position of needing a job. Thus I took the first programing job I was qualified for and it was with Domino's Pizza. It turns out that they lied and it was not in fact a programming job but a help desk job.

I had to come in at 4 in the AM and log in to remote stores and trouble shoot failed windows updates. I hate windows with a burning passion for reasons like this.  
(Aside: I would have done it having the servers run Linux with VMWare and just pushing a totally new image to the stores.)

So I quit that job after a week. I'm not cut out for the windows world.

(In this post's title, I don't know why safari capitalizes the 's' in Domino's)
