Barney Frank and Marsha Blackburn square off on Larry King Live over the stimulus bill. A few things that struck me about this interview. One, look at the body language with these two...lol. They both look like they don't want to even be on the same planet with each other, much less forced to sit next to each other at the same desk. Given how obvious that makes it that both of them really can't stand each other it's amazing they managed to keep it this civil. I feel like Marsha Blackburn normally is put up against weak liberals or uninformed commentators, and therefore she often looks like a rock star on the issues. Put her against an A+ public face of the progressive movement though? Her talking points fail one after another. All in all, i felt like Rep. Frank was not treated fairly in the interview. John King's line of questioning seemed to always accept whatever premise offered by the GOP. Democrats need to learn from Barny Frank; he doesn't sit back and take it, he questions and corrects the record.
