This is a wonderful moment that gives the viewer aninterestingperspective on two people whoabsolutelylive in their owns worlds. The next night, Bernie Golderberg comes on to take O'Reilly's side,[ also injecting that he sells more books than Ms. Coulter as well.](http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/epic-fail-bernie-goldbergs-advice-an) Which is a little crazy to hear, particularly when your me, the number one conservative author in the world. Whatever, dust off the shoulders right?
