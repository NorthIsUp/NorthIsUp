Employees over at Fox Business move at a different pace than most business news oragnizations. They don't get bogged down by complicated government reports that suggest (or straight up say) that we've been in a recession since last December. Nor does it matter that the entire media spectrum is screaming "RECESSION" at th top of its lungs . They're still running teaser segments questioning whether we're in a recession (much less a depression; a word some people are beginning to use). Example? The online store, Zappos.com, is enjoying its [best year ever](http://www.foxnews.com/video2/video08.html?maven_referralObject=3354348&maven_referralPlaylistId=&sRevUrl=http://www.foxnews.com/yourworld/)! hoooooooray!!!
