My review of [HoudahSpot](//www.houdah.com/houdahSpot') as seen on [MacZOT.com](//MacZOT.com')

Does Spotlight simply not give you enough control? Ever wonder where all that space goes but don't know how to use "du -hn" on the command line? Then check out HoudahSpot. It uses a simple logic system to enable specific searches involving AND & OR statements. 

**NOTE:** If you're seeing this on June 16, 2006 head over to MacZOT, you might be able to get a **Free** copy of HoudahSpot

Search easily in Tiger, Mac OS X, with [HoudahSpot](//www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/new.html')
