Obama is giving the science community something we've been desperately clawing at over the last eight years: an ear for the sciences. It will be amazing to see what the first pro-science administration can do in today's ultra connected world. I mean come on, YouTube has been around, why has Bush done ANYTHING with it yet? no Facebook page? 

12/20/08 President-elect Obama's Weekly Address 

> From landing on the moon, to sequencing the human genome, to inventing the Internet, America has been the first to cross that new frontier because we had leaders who paved the way: leaders like President Kennedy, who inspired us to push the boundaries of the known world and achieve the impossible; leaders who not only invested in our scientists, but who respected the integrity of the scientific process, ... Because the truth is that promoting science isn't just about providing resources -- it's about protecting free and open inquiry. It's about ensuring that facts and evidence are never twisted or obscured by politics or ideology. It's about listening to what our scientists have to say, even when it's inconvenient -- _especially_ when it's inconvenient. Because the highest purpose of science is the search for knowledge, truth and a greater understanding of the world around us.

Obama has already proven his ability to tame the beast that is the World Wide Web, let's see if he can be just as visionary elsewhere. Maybe it's just me, but but does anybody else find it ironic that we're all so excited about science, even more so because of the Bush administration being so against it?
