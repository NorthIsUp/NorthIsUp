We (god and I, not Daniel and I) have decided that we do not care about windows and are just doing the game in cocoa because its so slick and cool and so many other things and if it happens to run on windows thats great, or if somebody wants to port/maintain the windows side of it then thats great too, but we care about Mac users because they (will) care about us.

I use my computer, not tolerate it.
