![](http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/congress/members/photos/228/R000435.jpg) The Politco has an amusing piece regarding the manner in which President Elect Obama tried to greet Florida Rep. Lleana Ros-Lehtinen. 

> _On Wednesday, the Republican congresswoman got a call from President-elect Barack Obama, didn't believe it was him, and hung up on him. Twice._ _According to Ros-Lehtinen's flack Alex Cruz, the congresswoman received the call on her cell phone from a Chicago-based number and an aide informed her that Obama wanted to speak to her. When Obama introduced himself, Ros-Lehtinen cut him off and said, "I'm sorry but I think this is a joke from one of the South Florida radio stations known for these pranks." Then she hung up._

Oops. Obama's got a good sense of humor though, and he tried back a third time: 

> "It isvery funny that you have twice hung up on me," Obama said. Ros Lehtinen responded by telling Obama that radio stations in South Florida always make these sorts of jokes. Obama saidsimilar pranksters reside in Chi-town.

Reminds me of when [Sarah Palin got a prank call ](http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1108/Sarkozy_calling.html?showall)during the campaign from some Montreal radio hosts pretending to be French President Sarkozy. This goes along with my theory that conservatives don't get what humor is. They either see it when its not there (this example, or ANY attempt at humor from Malkin), or they don't get it when it is there.
