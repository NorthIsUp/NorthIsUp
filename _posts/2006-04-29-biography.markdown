Many people say "the future is now," and I believe they are right. From bionic arms to desktop computers that are approaching super computer performance, our technology is at a level that previous decades could only imagine. I, however, am not satisfied with this future. I am interested in the future of tomorrow and what I can bring to it.

The current focus of high performance computing is limited, but I believe that this is ripe for change. Chip makers are beginning to release more affordable multi-core chips, introducing high performance possibilities to desktop applications and operating systems. As we become increasingly aware of the power at our fingertips the demand for new ways to use it to its fullest potential will be great. Multi-core chips will also have an effect on scientific computing. The communication time between nodes in a cluster is currently a large obstacle to overcome. With multi-core chips on the rise, we will soon be able to treat each node in the cluster as a small symmetric multiprocessing machine. This will allow for new hybrid algorithms to better solve the hardest scientific and medical problems.
