Anderson Cooper finally expressed my own sentiments regarding the Lohan family. 

[](http://www.youtube.com/v/KJNToPNPMWM)

While the truly talentless Mom and her two failing starlets certainly have made an impression on my view of celebrity life- that, really, stars are people, too, and face emotionally sincere life obstacles- Cooper couldn't disagree less. I, too, wondered where Lindsay was when I watched the show (once) at M&M's Apartment. Where is that feminine raspy voice? Oh, right, it's whispering dark, sexy secrets in Ronson's ear. (Lindsay proves that beautiful stars don't always date someone as equally charming. Sorry, Ronson, but it's true.) ![](http://assets.nydailynews.com/img/2007/07/16/amd_ronson_lohan.jpg) (Ronson is the one on the left who looks like Golom taking a smoking break) In response to Cooper's rumors against the Lohan family, Lindsay firmly responded: "I'm tired of rumors starting/I'm tired of people lying/Saying what they want about me/Why can't they back up off me/Why can't they let me live/I'm gonna do it my way/Take this for just what it is." Ah, yes- atrocious.
