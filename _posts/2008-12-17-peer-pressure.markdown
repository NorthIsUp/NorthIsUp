Full disclosure: I am a frat boy. I live in a frat house. Not just any frat, but the largest frat. My brothers are Ronald Reagan, Conrad Hilton, Elvis Presley, Ron Jeremy and Senator Byrd. And let me just say, I love peer pressure.  Peer pressure gets a bad rap. It's invoked as the evil force that gets people to do drugs and take alcohol against their will. This builds up an expectation that some drug pusher is going to work relentlessly to get you to take drugs. To quote a dear brother of mine, "If I offer you drugs, I'm being nice. If you don't want them, more drugs for me." I have never maliciously offered a shot to anyone. If I offer you a shot, you're either my friend or someone I want to be my friend. It is a gift like any other gift. I'm not saying that peer pressure doesn't exist. It absolutely does. I'm just saying that it's not a bad thing. Peer pressure is, in fact, a perfectly legitimate way to pick your friends. If someone tells me to do something I'm not comfortable with, then he's a douche. I do not want to be his friend. If I tell someone to do something that they're not comfortable with, either I'm a douche or he's a tool. Through this process one can easily see how societal norms are established and upheld with the extremities of douchiness and toolity ostracized. If you're against ostracizing these people, then go hang out with them. So next time someone passes around tequila remember: It's not peer pressure, it's just your turn.
