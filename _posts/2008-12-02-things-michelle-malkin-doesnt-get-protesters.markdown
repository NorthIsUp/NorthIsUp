[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="384" caption="If her mouth isn't open, it means she's building up "conservative hate foam" to spew out"]![If her mouth isnt open, it means shes building up conservative hate foam to spew out](http://www.rightwingnews.com/graphics/malkinpowers.gif)[/caption] It appears that [Michell Malkin doesn't undersatnd](http://michellemalkin.com/2008/11/28/where-are-all-the-anti-inauguration-activists-now/) that protesters during the last two inaugurations weren't protesting against the idea of inaugurations, they were protesting against the guy being inaugurated. Does Malking really think they were protesting against the ceremony? Also, do you really want to be that guy protesting at the first black president's inauguration? Malkin's posts are written in a fire and brimstone anger that is barely contained by the text. 

> President Obama's Chicago machine is kicking into high gear to plan and fund his massive, unprecedented inaugural festivities. He just appointed an inauguration planning committee that _includes his hometown cronies_ William Daley and Penny Pritzker**.**They've got a [campaign-style website](http://www.pic2009.org/content/home/) counting down the days to the massive party in Washington. To **deflect attention from the costs, the One's party planners are [patting themselves on the back](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/us/politics/26inaug.html?ref=politics) for limiting inaugural donations to individual contributions of $50,000 **â€” a move_ they say i_s historic. But Bill Clinton also refused corporate money for his second inaugural and capped donations at $100. (Bush raised $42 million for his second inaugural, mostly from corporate donors, capped at $250,000.)

I mean come on. "hometown cronies" ? They planning a PARTY. It's not like these guys are running FEMA or anything. Cause that would be ridiculous, right? How can Malkin even consider this information critical of Obama? He's only accepting donations from individuals. He's the first person to ever cap donations. All of this, after Bush had a $40,000,000 inaugeral ball. *sound of hand slapping forehead*
