![](http://www.minnpost.com/client_files/alternate_images/2425/mp_main_wide_AlFranken031108.jpg) Cue [hair-trigger ](http://www.redstate.com/diaries/redstate/2008/nov/24/stealing-minnesota-what-the-hell-is-wrong-wi/)Conservative outrage in 3.....2.....1....(insert poorly written screed from Michell Malkin here). Looks like they are trying to stick to their pledge to count all the votes. Although, i sitll think they should be counting the absentee ballots that Franken [challenged](http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/senate/35126884.html) to have counted. One must jump through so many hoops already in order to cast a ballot today, why must our votes be dismissed because of a level of incompetence that is out of our hands?
