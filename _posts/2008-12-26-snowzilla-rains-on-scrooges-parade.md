I'm so happy that somewhere out there, someone was able to spite their neighbor with a snowman. This is what the holiday season is all about.

> ANCHORAGE, Alaska - Someone has told the city of Anchorage what it can do with its cease-and-desist order to prevent Snowzilla - the giant snowman - from rising up again this winter in an east Anchorage neighborhood. **Snowzilla - thought to be no more - is yet again**. Someone again built the giant snowman in Billy Powers' front yard. Snowzilla reappeared overnight. ... For several years, Snowzilla has risen in the front yard of Powers' modest home. His children - he has five still at home - collected snow from neighbors' yards to make the snowman big enough. Each year, Snowzilla got a bit bigger. Not everybody in the neighborhood liked all the cars and visitors who came to see him. City officials this year deemed Snowzilla a public nuisance and safety hazard. A cease-and-desist order was issued. The city tacked a public notice on Powers' door. City officials said the structure increased traffic to the point of endangerment and that the snowman itself was unsafe.

So, who does this remind you of? One thought came to mind for me. ![](http://hoboken411.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/calvin-and-hobbes-snowmen.gif)
