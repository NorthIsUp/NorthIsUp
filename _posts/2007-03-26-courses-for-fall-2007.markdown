Thus far I have chosen Parallel Computing and Distributed Computing Systems. The parallel class will have a greater emphasis on OpenMP opposed to years past where the focus was MPI. This is because of the increasing trend of multi core chips. The distributed computing class will focus on reliability, security, and other related issues. Most exciting is the possibility to use Xgrid for the research project in both classes!
