Well, not all of the web. But several websites I go to are suffering from share-overload. Every single bit of content has not just a share button, but a share button for every service that allows you to share anything. Each button represents an iframe that must do some javascripty things and some more https fetches. This is bad because it makes the web slow and furthermore all that extra work grinds away precious minutes on my laptop's battery. AdBlock to the rescue! Just add this url to your ad block lists: https://monzta.maltekraus.de/adblock_social.txt
