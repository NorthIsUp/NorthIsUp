I'm usually one of those people who hates the feeling of being advertised to. Not because i hate ads or consumption, but because ads are just so uncomfortably pervasive in our culture. I'm never really sure if im looking at art or "art". This commercial however is so creative, and the idea is perfectly executed, that i can't help but try to appreciate its artistic value.
