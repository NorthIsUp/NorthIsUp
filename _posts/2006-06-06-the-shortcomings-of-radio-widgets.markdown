I have noticed a sizable gap in the offering of radio widgets. Each widget is specifically programmed for a single station or small group of stations. Of the hundreds of radio widgets there is no single widget that can play a stream based of user input.

The first version I will be releasing soon allows users to add and remove streams from a playlist and select which kind of media player the stream requires. It will also be 'garbage in garbage out.' Version two will include code that will automatically determine what player should be used and if that player is actually installed. Furthermore version two will be able to check as to if the stream entered is a valid stream.
