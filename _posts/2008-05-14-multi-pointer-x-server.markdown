Here is a video I found demonstrating MPX, the Multi-Pointer X Server. MPX is scheduled to be merged into the main X branch this month so soon we will all be having some multi-pointer fun. This will be a great boon for all the [multi-touch home brewers](http://multitouch.fieryferret.com/2008/05/creating-new-ftir-frame.html) out there.
