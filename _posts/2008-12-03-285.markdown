![Michelle Malkin, one of those 23% who still approves of Bush.](http://home.comcast.net/~fenrisulven/Michelle-Malkin.jpg)

> There's gotta be someone out there up for making the other Prop. 8 musical â€” the one with angry activists storming restaurants and Mormon temples, hectoring elderly people over their signs, and hounding donors large and small until they pay off their tormentors in the name of tolerance. Anyone?

Yep, Michelle Malkin is actually using [her blog to ](http://michellemalkin.com/2008/12/03/who-will-make-the-other-prop-8-musical/)[encourage people to make anti-gay musicals](http://michellemalkin.com/2008/12/03/who-will-make-the-other-prop-8-musical/)[.](http://michellemalkin.com/2008/12/03/who-will-make-the-other-prop-8-musical/) How childish is she? The pro-gay movement is making a musical, the anti-gay crowd needs one too! This is why nobody takes you seriously michelle. Also, comedy tip: racism + sarcasm is not a good way to get laughs (seriously, read through you last 3 years of blog posts. that's your comedy formula) [the musical she is responding to?](http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/c0cf508ff8/prop-8-the-musical-starring-jack-black-john-c-reilly-and-many-more-from-fod-team-jack-black-craig-robinson-john-c-reilly-and-rashida-jones) Yep, it's from Will Ferral's humor site Funny or Die. Conservatives just don't understand that the status quo isn't funny. That's why the 24 hour news hour didn't work, and why Bill O'Reilly doesn't think the Daily Show is funny.
