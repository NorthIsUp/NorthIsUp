For my networking class we were assigned to write an IMAP client. We were told exactly that and where the RFC document was, everything else was up to us. I decided to make mine in cocoa and wow, was that an experiance.

Never before have I used such an intuitive language! From semaphores and threads to the date it had everything one could ever want in a programing language. The only dissapointment was that there was no awesome cocoa style BSDSockets support (we ended up using the NSFilehandle class which made all the network communication transparent to us as programers anyways; awesome!).

In short, I now know cocoa fairly well and have fallen completely in love with it.
