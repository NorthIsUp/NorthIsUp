[Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE)](http://www.acm.org/upe/) was founded in 1967 as an honor society for the computing sciences by students at Texas A&M University. UPE is an independent organization which has received recognition from both the ACM (1967) and the IEEE-CS (1992) as an official honor society. At this writing, there are more than 120 UPE chapters worldwide.
