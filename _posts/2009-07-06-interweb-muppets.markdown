I miss the Muppets, not Pigs In Space, but the rest of the Muppets. Occasionally a movie would come out but it never captured the feel of the original Muppets Show. Then I stumbled on this YouTube playlist that occasionally gets some new content from the master Muppeteers at Jim Henson Studios. The Muppets are back and in expert satirical form they are poking fun at some of our favorite internet meemes from the skateboarding dog to the one person YouTube orchestras. And all of this with the poignant criticism of Statler and Waldorf. [Check out the Muppets](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=6289F95CD6B8F803)
