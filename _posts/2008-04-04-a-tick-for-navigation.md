**If you're lost in the Northern Hemisphere:** Move your watch so that 12 o'clock is pointed to the left. Then, move your arm so the hour hand points at the sun. The spot halfway between the hour-hand and the 12 o'clock is SOUTH. **If you're lost in the Southern Hemisphere:** Point your watch with 12 o'clock pointed at the sun. The spot halfway between that and the current placement of the hour-hand is NORTH.
