![](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/12/22/business/22digital02-190.jpg) I was reading the NYT this morning and i stumbled across a [not-all-that-surprising piece of information](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/22/technology/22digital.html?_r=2&ref=business): the digital transition might be a complete failure thanks to the utter incompetence of the general public. Kind of reminds me of all those people who can't locate the United States on a map 

> According to surveys conducted by the [Consumers Union](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/consumers_union/index.html?inline=nyt-org), a consumer advocacy group that also publishes Consumer Reports magazine, while 90 percent of the nation is aware of the transition, 25 percent mistakenly believe that one must subscribe to cable or satellite after February, and 41 percent think that every TV in a house must have a new converter box, even those that are already connected to cable or satellite. ... To help reduce the expense of acquiring the converter boxes, which cost about $50 for basic models, consumers can get two government rebate vouchers worth $40 a box. (Available at [www.dtv2009.gov](http://www.dtv2009.gov/) or 888-388-2009.) About 40 million coupons have been requested, but to date 16 million have been redeemed, compared with an estimated 35 million televisions that will lose a signal. Adding to the problem: people who obtained coupons early this year, but never redeemed them, have discovered that they expire after 90 days. They are not allowed to reapply for vouchers (though they could use someone else's coupon).
