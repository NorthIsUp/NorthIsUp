  1. A Chrome Citizen Messenger Bag
  2. [Leatherman Skeletool CX](http://www.amazon.com/Leatherman-830850-Skeletool-CX-Multitool/dp/B000XU43IC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1312818013&sr=8-2) Only wish it had tweezers, otherwise its great. Knife, Pliers, Bottle opener, screwdriver+interchangeable bits.
  3. [Jawbone JAMBOX](http://www.amazon.com/Jawbone-JBE03-JAMBOX-Black-Diamond/dp/B004E10KI8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1312818111&sr=8-1) Best way to take music with ou
  4. [Belkin Mini Surge Protector Dual USB Charger](http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Mini-Surge-Protector-Charger/dp/B0015DYMVO/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1312818046&sr=1-1) Charges my USB stuff (iPhone/iPad/Jambox) on the go, severely cuts down on the dongle count.
  5. [A few carabiners](http://www.amazon.com/True-Fabrications-Double-Hinged-Corkscrew/dp/B002T435CA/ref=acc_glance_k_ai_ps_t2_t_5) Usually just used for keychains/clipping shit to. I always get load bearing carabiners because once in a while I use them to tow or lift stuff (b.y.o. rope).
  6. [Front and rear bike lights, charges via USB](http://www.amazon.com/Blackburn-Flea-Front-Flea-Combo-Headlight/dp/B002RQIAB6/ref=acc_glance_sg_ai_ps_t2_t_3) Safety first! The front light is usually affixed to my bike helmet, the rear is always on my bag. Day or night its on when I'm riding.
