from the AP: "Joe the Plumber—famous for being a campaign '08 ploy—plans to go to Israel to cover the conflict in Gaza for conservative Web site pjtv.com. Samuel Wurzelbacher will spend ten days there to report on the "Average Joes" in Israel, he told a Toledo TV station. During the campaign, Wurzelbacher was called out by Fox News anchor Shepard Smith for claiming a vote for Obama would mean the end of Israel."  I'm sure he'll do a totally below-average job too. If there's one thing that i know about writing, is that people of average intelligence are shitty writers. Think about it for a second. Think about all the papers you've written and read during school. It was the above-average over achievers who wrote often-correct papers that achieved high marks, but the quality of the writing was almost always banal and mundane, never written in a human voice. Then consider the papers written by those of "average" intelligence. It was liking putting together a puzzle where you knew what the final picture was. You know what the person is trying to say, but the words just form a confusing mess on the paper. Of course, those students of superb cerebral quality had powerful prose, wrote in unique voices, and had compelling thoughts. Most journalists, (yes, realistically most) fall into the latter group. Joe the fucking Dumb ass plumber is at least average, probably below average; let's be honest, we watched him for three weeks and he didn't display even an average command of the issues. I expect to see the intellectual rigor of "Kidz News" applied to the obliquely conservative ideas espoused on talk radio. **Joe, thinking really really hard about something: (add your guess to the comments)** ![](http://www.latimes.com/media/photo/2008-10/42921942.jpg)Technorati Tags: [Joe the plumber](http://technorati.com/tag/Joe%20the%20plumber), [middle east](http://technorati.com/tag/middle%20east), [media](http://technorati.com/tag/media) I really want this "man on the street" journalism trend to stop. If i really wanted to hear what Mr. "I don't have a degree in journalism" has to say about the conlfict in the Middle East. If i did, i would go to twitter and wach the text vomit slap me in the face. At least then i'd get those emoticons that only japanese people could dream up. While i'm talking about the media, does anybody else feel like MSNBC has become the de facto cable version of Break.com? It has like 8 hours of "you gotta see it to believe it" stylen shows every day, and that doens't include 6 hours of prison (why?) shows.
