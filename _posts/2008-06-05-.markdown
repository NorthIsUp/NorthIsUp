andy and wayne, Thanks for the generous gifts of cash and shoes. The Keens are amongst the most comfy shoes I have worn in a long time rivaling my Crocs (and as a bonus they are not hideous like Crocs). I hope your adventures on the Macintosh platform are going well, if you have any problems send them my way as I am going to an Apple conference in San Francisco next week and maybe I'll have the chance to forward them to Steve Jobs or some other Apple execs. Thanks Again, Adam
