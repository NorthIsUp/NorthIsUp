Repost from Engadget You know, we love fighting the good fight -- especially if it means calling out corporations on their untoward business practices. Today we're joining David Pogue of the_New York Times_ in calling foul on cellphone carriers' insistence that users be forced to listen to those maddening, pointless 15-second canned carrier messages. In case you've held off on owning a cellphone or calling anyone who has one, they go a little something like this:  


> At the tone, please record your message. When you have finished recording, you may hang up, or press 1 for more options. To leave a callback number, press 5. (Beep)  


Not only is Pogue mad-as-hell-and-not-going-to-take-it about the ridiculous idea that we still need to be told how to use voicemail, it turns out those additional messages are actually costing you cold, hard cash. He estimates that Verizon, for instance, is netting around $620 million a year thanks to these little annoyances. So what's to be done? Well Pogue wants the citizens of the internet to take up virtual arms... and complain like nobody's business. He's wrangled together all the best contact points for the four largest carriers in the US (included for your convenience after the break). Let them know you know don't want to pay for voicemail instructions. And hey, while you're at it, tell them the[price-gouging on text messages](http://www.engadget.com/2008/12/28/the-truth-about-text-messaging-youre-getting-ripped-off/)needs to go, too.
