![Erdos example](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Erdosnumber.png) [Paul Erdos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s), the Hungarian mathematician, was famously prolific, with hundreds of collaborators in his lifetime. To honor him, mathematicians calculate their [Erdos Numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number): Paul Erdos himself has an Erdos Number of zero. Everyone that he directly collaborated with has an Erdos Number of one, everyone that _they_ collaborated with has an Erdos Number of two, and so on. This also happens in other fields. In physics, for example, people calculate their Pauli Numbers, for [Wolfgang Pauli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli), and of course, in the movie industry, people calculate their [Bacon Numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon_number), for [Kevin Bacon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Bacon). Some very cool individuals have both an Erdos Number _and_ a Bacon Number, allowing them to calculate their (finite) [Erdos-Bacon Number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s-Bacon_number). The smallest known Erdos-Bacon Number is three, and it belongs to Daniel Kleitman, a mathematician at MIT.
