I was fortunate enough to be at the World Premiere of Micael Moore's new film [Slacker Uprising](http://slackeruprising.com). Moore's new film takes you on a journey. A familiar one for those who were involved in the 2004 election. It follows Moore's failed attempts to help the Democrats win the White House. The film was bitter sweet for me. It didn't tackle any major societal issues. And it didn't contain the usual proselytizing.
