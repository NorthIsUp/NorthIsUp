[iClip](http://inventive.us/) is an elegant solution to the single clipboard problem with previous versions being nominated for Apple Design awards and the iClip widget winning best widget. iClip provides live previews of stored items allowing fast and intuitive access to your stored items. In the end iClip is a great way to store images, text and just about anything else you can think of for short term use. Today [macZot](macZot.com) is offering iClip for $29.00 with 10Â¢ off for every blog review. So hopefully it will be FREE by the end of the day!
