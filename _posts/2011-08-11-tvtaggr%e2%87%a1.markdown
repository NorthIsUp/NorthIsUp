**TvTaggr is very much unmaintained, but I've put the source on GitHub if anybody wants to fix it up. I just got a new AppleTV, so we'll see what happens in my free time ;) [Source](http://github.com/NorthIsUp/TvTaggr)** **[Download Now!](http://northisup.net/appcast/enclosures/TvTaggr.dmg)** UPDATES: Thanks Digg for all the feedback. Because you asked for it TvTaggr⇡ will have file name handling and cddb style lookup! Both will be coming in updates over the next few weeks. TvTaggr easily allows you to edit the metadata on a single movie file or to apply changes to a batch of files. The interface is familiar to anyone who has edited tags in iTunes. It is perfect for adding information to home movies or podcasts. TvTaggr⇡ works on standard mp4 files and m4v files downloaded from iTunes. While this app does not look like it should be Leopard only it is, there is a lot going on under the hood that is leopard specific, or in other words, one more reason to upgrade! Always be up to date now that TvTaggr⇡ uses Sparkle appcasts! Appcasts are RSS feeds which allow programs to check for new versions, so TvTaggr⇡ knows when there is a new version. TvTaggr⇡ can auto-update on its own, or you can follow the appcast feed yourself. Universal binary runs on all platforms supported by Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard The interface is simple (just like the one in iTunes), on the right is the files drawer, drag in the files you wish to edit, check the boxes next to the fields you want to edit, and hit “Apply All” TvTaggr works by using the GPL utility Atomic Parsley. If you don't use OS X you can use the command line version found at their website. Since TvTaggr uses the Atomic Parsley libraries it is only able to edit the data types Atomic Parsley supports. If there is enough demand I could add more support. Do you have any ideas or suggestions? Then send me your thoughts!
