For anyone who hasn't been paying attention, there is a cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe. This all started when sanitation workers and mechanical engineers stopped coming into work because they weren't getting paid. This caused pipes to burst, so they shut off the water. How you cure cholera is gatorade and acne medication. The problem is that there's no water and the medical staff isn't getting paid either. Mugabe is now claiming that the cholera epidemic has ended, and thus there is no longer a need for the U.S. and Britain to invade Zimbabwe, though he added that Britain ought to be invaded because they have mad cow disease.  What I seem to have missed is the call for the U.S. and Britain to invade Zimbabwe in the first place. Mugabe is so delusional at this point that he actually believes the "colonial powers" are looking for (or even require) a pretext to invade Zimbabwe. Let me just say that there is no way the epidemic is cured because the economy is not cured. But Mr. Mugabe, I will happily be your straw man: On behalf of the colonial powers, I think we should invade Zimbabwe and arrest Mugabe for failing to attempt to solve the 4 year old humanitarian crisis. Perhaps this is work for His Majesty, President Obama. Mr. Mugabe, in your words, go hang.
