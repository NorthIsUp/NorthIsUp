WWDC 2005, WWDC 2006, WWDC 2007, and now WWDC 2008. The list keeps on growing. This is the fourth year in a row I have been accepted under Apple's student scholarship program to WWDC. This year looks to be chock full of iPhone-y goodness. I've downloaded the SDK and will hopefully have two applications ready by WWDC. One is a simple dictionary app, a good start to learning the SDK. The second will be something with the Location API.
