You've got your sweet iPhone app. Its got 12 rotating screens that look like a lotus, displaying the raw power of your app. It runs great in the simulator. Reality sinks in when you run it on your phone and get 1 frame per second... Instruments has a bunch of great profiling tools, but the performance characteristics of the simulator are completely different from real hardware, and if you're like me, it crashes the app on your phone
