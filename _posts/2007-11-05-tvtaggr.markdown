TVTaggr is software with a simple purpose. To edit mp4 and m4v metadata in batch quantities. It is currently in between alpha and beta, but I thought I'd let it out for you all to try. It _is_ Leopard only (I know it doesn't look like a Leopard only app, but it uses Leopard functionality under the hood). Please give me feedback in the comments!
