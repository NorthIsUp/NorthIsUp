Nate Silver, on his now pollster cannon blog [fivethirtyeight.com](fivethrityeight.com), has a good [post on the swing senators for both parties ](http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/12/who-are-swing-senators.html)that all of us should be keeping our eyes on over the next two years: 

> In practice, there will be a group of four or five senators in each party who line up just to either side of the 60-seat threshold and will find that they're suddenly very much in demand. If Obama's approval ratings are strong, he should have little trouble whipping the couple of Republican votes he needs into shape, and should clear 60 comfortably on key issues. But, if Obama proves to be unpopular, there remain enough conservative, red-state Democratic senators to deny him a simple majority on key issues, much less 60 votes.
