I worked on the Obama campaign, have been to many rallies and even helped staff some of them. But it wasn't until you got about 2000 of us together in a room that the energy reached a level I had not seen during the campaign. In Obama's closing remarks of the inaugural festivities he thanks those that helped him get where he is now. This is hands down one of his best speeches to date. Video after the break.
