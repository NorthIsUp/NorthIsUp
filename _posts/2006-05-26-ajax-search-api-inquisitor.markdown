I have been using the inquisitor safari plugin. Basically it uses the google search APIs to give live as-you-type results in the safari search bar. It shows the top 5 google hits, auto completion, and the google 'did you mean' feature. Furthermore it also enables the use of other non-Google engines. Simply a must have for any serious web searcher.

For the [AJAX web version](http://www.inquisitorx.com/beta/) and the [safari plugin](http://www.inquisitorx.com/safari/)
