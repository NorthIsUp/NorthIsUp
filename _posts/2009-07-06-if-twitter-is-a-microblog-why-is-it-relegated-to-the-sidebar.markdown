Why is it that people's twitter feeds are shoved off to the side when it comes to their blog? If twitter is a form of microblogging then shouldn't it be integrated to a higher degree than just a sidebar widget? To this end I have attempted to intertwine my blog posts and my tweets. Ill let this experiment go on for a few weeks to see how the interlaced tweets affect the signal to noise ratio of the site in general.
