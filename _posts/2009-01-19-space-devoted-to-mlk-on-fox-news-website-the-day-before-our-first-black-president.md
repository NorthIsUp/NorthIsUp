I was thinking about starting a separate blog where i take a snapshot of foxnews.com every day, and highlighted the obvious conservative slanted issue stories on the front page, just to see a different aspect of the fox news institutional right wing bias. I would specifically look at stories that are being propped up to demonstrate a larger cause. I tend to call these "republican victim" stories.
