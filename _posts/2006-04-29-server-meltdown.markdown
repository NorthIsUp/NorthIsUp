So, my server melted and we moved to professional hosting.  
I did my best to recover my previous posts and get the dates right, but I just gave up after a while. I was unable to recover any posts from the past 10 months or so.

So that is why 1) there is sparse content as of right now and 2) all the dates are within a few minutes of each other.

Sorry if this causes anybody besides myself inconvenience.
