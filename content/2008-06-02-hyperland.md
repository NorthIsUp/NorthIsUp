This self-proclaimed "fantasy documentary" looks into the future of non-linear interactive media after getting sick of non-interactive linear television. The paradigm he explores is a search engine anthropomorphized as a butler. The butler, Tom, introduces himself as a desktop application intent on helping Douglas navigate and explore this non-linear hypertext system (not so web 2.0, but hey its 1990). Some might find it reminiscent of Apple Computer's Knowledge Navigator concept. From Wikipedia: 

> Hyperland is a 50 minute long documentary film about hypertext and surrounding technologies written by Douglas Adams and produced by BBC Two in 1990. It stars Douglas Adams as a computer user and Tom Baker, with whom Adams already had worked on Doctor Who, as a software agent.
